# roli

A relatively low level wrapper for the Rolimons.com api.

# Note

This crate is a low level wrapper due to the fact that allowed requests to the api are limited. To maintain flexibiliy while also using the api endpoints responsibly, the user is expected to maintain their own caching.

# Documentation
Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rs/roli/0.0.1/roli/).

# Api Coverage Checklist
- [x] Items Api
- [ ] Trade Ad Api
- [ ] Deals Api
- [ ] Games Api

(more to be added, issues for api coverage requests welcome)

# Contributing
There is still a lot of work to be done! Pull requests are welcome!

Note that all public non-util functions are required to make exactly one api call.
